## What is Agent2Agent (A2A)?

Agent2Agent (A2A) is an open protocol developed by Google that enables communication and interoperability between AI agents built on different frameworks and by different vendors. The protocol provides a standardized way for agents to discover each other's capabilities, negotiate interactions, and work together securely.

## TODO

Our Team will work on the next tasks, and ASAP add them in this repo.

- [ ] Agent2Agent API Templates
> This repository provides reference implementation templates that allow developers to quickly set up Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol-compliant services. These templates are configured based on the official protocol specifications and documentation, enabling rapid development of A2A-compatible agents.
- [ ] MCP-based A2A Server Using
> While we continue to explore the relationship between Google's Multimodal Conversational Platform (MCP) and the Agent2Agent protocol, we've implemented a pragmatic approach - utilizing MCP technology to wrap protocol-compliant agents as MCP servers. This approach allows for maximum interoperability while maintaining protocol compliance.
> Key features of our template:
> - Full implementation of the A2A HTTP request specifications
> - Session management for maintaining conversation context
> - Structured response handling according to protocol requirements
> - Ready-to-use FastAPI implementation with OpenAPI documentation
> - Extension points for custom agent logic and capabilities
> The template accelerates development by handling all low-level protocol requirements, allowing developers to focus on agent implementation logic rather than protocol compliance details.
- [ ] Agents Hub
> The Agents Hub is a web-based interface that facilitates interaction with A2A-compliant agents. It serves as both a development tool and a demonstration platform for the Agent2Agent ecosystem.
> Features
> - **Agent Discovery and Management**: Connect to any A2A-compliant agent by providing its Base URL
> - **Interactive Testing**: Communicate with agents through a user-friendly interface that handles all protocol details
> - **Session Management**: Automatic maintenance of conversation contexts and session IDs
> - **Pre-configured Agents Gallery**: Access to a curated collection of ready-to-use A2A-compliant agents
> - **Conversation History**: Track and review past interactions with different agents
> - **Capability Exploration**: Discover and test various agent capabilities within the protocol's specifications
> The Agents Hub is designed to simplify the development, testing, and demonstration of A2A-compliant agents, providing a unified interface for interacting with diverse agent implementations across the ecosystem.
